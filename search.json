In this vignette I’ll use a temporary board which is automatically deleted when your Python session is over:\n\nboard = board_temp()\n\nIn real life, you’d pick a board depending on how you want to share the data. Here are a few options:\nboard = board_local() # share data across R sessions on the same computer\nboard = board_folder(\"~/Dropbox\") # share data with others using dropbox\nboard = board_folder(\"Z:\\\\my-team\\pins\") # share data using a shared network drive\nboard = board_connect() # share data with Posit Connect"

    "text": "Reading and writing data\nOnce you have a pin board, you can write data to it with the pin_write method:\n\nfrom pins.data import mtcars\n\nmeta = board.pin_write(mtcars, \"mtcars\", type=\"csv\")\n\nWriting pin:\nName: 'mtcars'\nVersion: 20231102T215249Z-3b134\n\n\nThe first argument is the object to save (usually a data frame, but it can be any Python object), and the second argument gives the “name” of the pin. The name is basically equivalent to a file name; you’ll use it when you later want to read the data from the pin. The only rule for a pin name is that it can’t contain slashes.\nAbove, we saved the data as a CSV, but you can choose another option depending on your goals:\n\ntype = \"csv\" uses to_csv() from pandas to create a CSV file. CSVs are plain text and can be read easily by many applications, but they only support simple columns (e.g. numbers, strings), can take up a lot of disk space, and can be slow to read.\ntype = \"parquet\" uses to_parquet() from pandas to create a Parquet file. Parquet is a modern, language-independent, column-oriented file format for efficient data storage and retrieval. Parquet is an excellent choice for storing tabular data.\ntype = \"arrow\" uses to_feather() from pandas to create an Arrow/Feather file.\ntype = \"joblib\" uses joblib.dump() to create a binary Python data file, such as for storing a trained model. See the joblib docs for more information.\ntype = \"json\" uses json.dump() to create a JSON file. Pretty much every programming language can read JSON files, but they only work well for nested lists.\n\nAfter you’ve pinned an object, you can read it back with pin_read:\n\nboard.pin_read(\"mtcars\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n\n0\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n1\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n2\n22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n3\n21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n4\n18.7\n8\n360.0\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n27\n30.4\n4\n95.1\n113\n3.77\n1.513\n16.90\n1\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n28\n15.8\n8\n351.0\n264\n4.22\n3.170\n14.50\n0\n1\n5\n4\n\n\n29\n19.7\n6\n145.0\n175\n3.62\n2.770\n15.50\n0\n1\n5\n6\n\n\n30\n15.0\n8\n301.0\n335\n3.54\n3.570\n14.60\n0\n1\n5\n8\n\n\n31\n21.4\n4\n121.0\n109\n4.11\n2.780\n18.60\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\n32 rows × 11 columns\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to supply the file type when reading data from a pin because pins automatically stores the file type in the metadata, the topic of the next section.\nNote that when the data lives elsewhere, pins takes care of downloading and caching so that it’s only re-downloaded when needed. That said, most boards transmit pins over HTTP, and this is going to be slow and possibly unreliable for very large pins. As a general rule of thumb, we don’t recommend using pins with files over 500 MB. If you find yourself routinely pinning data larger that this, you might need to reconsider your data engineering pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are using the Posit Connect board board_connect, then you must specify your pin name as \"user_name/content_name\". For example, \"hadley/sales-report\"."

    "text": "Caching\nThe primary purpose of pins is to make it easy to share data. But pins is also designed to help you spend as little time as possible downloading data. pin_read and pin_download automatically cache remote pins: they maintain a local copy of the data (so it’s fast) but always check that it’s up-to-date (so your analysis doesn’t use stale data).\nWouldn’t it be nice if you could take advantage of this feature for any dataset on the internet? That’s the idea behind board_url; you can assemble your own board from datasets, wherever they live on the internet. For example, this code creates a board containing a single pin, penguins, that refers to some fun data I found on GitHub:\n\nmy_data = board_url(\"\", {\n  \"penguins\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_raw.csv\"\n})\n\nYou can read this data by combining pin_download with read_csv from pandas:\n\nfname = my_data.pin_download(\"penguins\")\n\nfname\n\n['/home/runner/.cache/pins-py/http_e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855/e6ac0d2da33fad7e72df6b900933a691b89ed7d54ec0e4a36fe45c32d7e2f67e_penguins_raw.csv']\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.read_csv(fname[0]).head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudyName\nSample Number\nSpecies\nRegion\nIsland\nStage\nIndividual ID\nClutch Completion\nDate Egg\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nSex\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nComments\n\n\n\n\n0\nPAL0708\n1\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN1A1\nYes\n2007-11-11\n39.1\n18.7\n181.0\n3750.0\nMALE\nNaN\nNaN\nNot enough blood for isotopes.\n\n\n1\nPAL0708\n2\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN1A2\nYes\n2007-11-11\n39.5\n17.4\n186.0\n3800.0\nFEMALE\n8.94956\n-24.69454\nNaN\n\n\n2\nPAL0708\n3\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN2A1\nYes\n2007-11-16\n40.3\n18.0\n195.0\n3250.0\nFEMALE\n8.36821\n-25.33302\nNaN\n\n\n3\nPAL0708\n4\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN2A2\nYes\n2007-11-16\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAdult not sampled.\n\n\n4\nPAL0708\n5\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN3A1\nYes\n2007-11-16\n36.7\n19.3\n193.0\n3450.0\nFEMALE\n8.76651\n-25.32426\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy_data.pin_download(\"penguins\")\n\n['/home/runner/.cache/pins-py/http_e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855/e6ac0d2da33fad7e72df6b900933a691b89ed7d54ec0e4a36fe45c32d7e2f67e_penguins_raw.csv']"

Here we’ll use a special version of board_folder called board_temp which creates a temporary board that’s automatically deleted when your Python script or notebook session ends. This is great for examples, but obviously you shouldn’t use it for real work!\n\nimport pins\nfrom pins.data import mtcars\n\nboard = pins.board_temp()\n\nYou can “pin” (save) data to a board with the pin_write method. It requires three arguments: an object, a name, and a pin type:\n\nboard.pin_write(mtcars.head(), \"mtcars\", type=\"csv\")\n\nWriting pin:\nName: 'mtcars'\nVersion: 20231102T215240Z-120a5\n\n\nMeta(title='mtcars: a pinned 5 x 11 DataFrame', description=None, created='20231102T215240Z', pin_hash='120a54f7e0818041', file='mtcars.csv', file_size=249, type='csv', api_version=1, version=Version(created=datetime.datetime(2023, 11, 2, 21, 52, 40, 494398), hash='120a54f7e0818041'), tags=None, name='mtcars', user={}, local={})\n\n\nAbove, we saved the data as a CSV, but depending on what you’re saving and who else you want to read it, you might use the type argument to instead save it as a joblib, parquet, or json file.\nYou can later retrieve the pinned data with pin_read:\n\nboard.pin_read(\"mtcars\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n\n0\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n1\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n2\n22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n3\n21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n4\n18.7\n8\n360.0\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA board on your computer is good place to start, but the real power of pins comes when you use a board that’s shared with multiple people. To get started, you can use board_folder with a directory on a shared drive or in DropBox, or if you use Posit Connect you can use board_connect:\n# Note that this uses one approach to connecting,\n# the environment variables CONNECT_SERVER and CONNECT_API_KEY\n\nboard = pins.board_connect()\nboard.pin_write(tidy_sales_data, \"hadley/sales-summary\", type=\"csv\")\nThen, someone else (or an automated report) can read and use your pin:\nboard = board_connect()\nboard.pin_read(\"hadley/sales-summary\")\nYou can easily control who gets to access the data using the Posit Connect permissions pane.\nThe pins package also includes boards that allow you to share data on services like Amazon’s S3 (board_s3), Google Cloud Storage (board_gcs), and Azure blob storage (board_azure)."
